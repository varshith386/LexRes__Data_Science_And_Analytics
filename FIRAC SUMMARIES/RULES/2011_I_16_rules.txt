Corruption by Public Servants: Corruption among public servants is pervasive and severely detrimental to the efficient functioning of public service and nation-building activities.

Article 142 of the Constitution: Article 142 grants the Supreme Court discretionary power to pass orders to do complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it. However, this power is subject to limitations:

It cannot be used to contravene or ignore substantive statutory provisions.
It should not be exercised merely on grounds of sympathy or sentiment.
The court must ensure that its exercise does not conflict with what has been expressly provided for in statutes.
