Absolute vs. Partial Dedication: Determining whether a property is absolutely or partially dedicated to an idol depends on the will's language and the testator's intent.
Adverse Possession: For adverse possession to extinguish the original owner’s title, possession must be open, notorious, and hostile for a continuous period.
Sevayat’s Role: A sevayat’s (trustee’s) possession of property dedicated to an idol is on behalf of the idol, and their actions must align with their duties to the idol.
