Regularization and permanent status require compliance with specific statutory provisions. Under the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1961, and the Madhya Pradesh Industrial Relations Act, 1961, employees must be classified into categories such as permanent, temporary, or probationary. For permanent status, employees must be appointed against a clear vacancy and issued a permanent employee ticket as per Order 3 of the Standard Standing Orders.
Recruitment must follow the procedures laid down by the 1973 Act and the 1987 Rules. Regularization does not imply permanency without an existing post.
The principle of 'equal pay for equal work' applies only when employees hold sanctioned posts and undergo regular recruitment processes.
