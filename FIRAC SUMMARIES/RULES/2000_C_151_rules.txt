The AICTE Act, 1987, particularly Section 10(k), vests authority in the AICTE to grant approval for the establishment of technical institutions. Any state law requiring approval for such institutions would be repugnant to the AICTE Act and hence void (as per the judgment in the Tamil Nadu case). The university's role in granting affiliation must not conflict with the provisions of the AICTE Act or its regulations.
