Circumstantial evidence must conclusively establish guilt and be consistent only with the hypothesis of the accused's guilt, excluding any other reasonable explanation.
False plea of alibi can be considered as an additional link in circumstantial evidence if it meets specific conditions.
The accused's conduct, including absconding, can be considered as incriminating evidence if proven beyond doubt.
