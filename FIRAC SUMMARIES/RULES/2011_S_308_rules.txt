Land Acquisition Act, 1894: Section 5A provides landowners the right to object to the acquisition and mandates inquiry into objections before a declaration under Section 6 can be made.
Emergency Provisions (Section 17): Section 17 allows for dispensing with the inquiry under Section 5A in cases of urgency. However, this power must be exercised sparingly and strictly construed.
Judicial Review: Courts must ensure that acquisition for public purposes is not arbitrary and strictly complies with statutory requirements, including procedural safeguards.
