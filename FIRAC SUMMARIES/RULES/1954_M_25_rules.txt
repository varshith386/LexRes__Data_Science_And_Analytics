Bonus is generally considered a boon or gift over and above nominal remuneration.
According to labour principles, bonus can be demanded if:
Wages fall short of the living standard.
The industry makes huge profits partly due to workers' contributions.
The Labour Appellate Tribunal's formula for bonus distribution involves:
Provision for depreciation.
Reserves for rehabilitation.
Return on paid-up and working capital.
Surplus profits available for distribution as bonus.
Bonus is not a deferred wage and is contingent on the industrial concern making profits.
