The principles of natural justice, as derived from previous rulings such as Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner, mandate fair treatment and a reasonable opportunity to be heard before making adverse decisions.
Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India require non-arbitrary state actions, especially in appointments.
The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan case allows bypassing natural justice principles if the appointments are null and void.
