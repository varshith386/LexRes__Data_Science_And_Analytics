The case involves an appeal by four accused against a common judgment from the High Court of Chhattisgarh, affirming their conviction under Section 302 read with Sections 34 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
The appellants were convicted for the murder of Bhavna Tripathi, the daughter-in-law of one of the accused, Shashi Tripathi.
The crime occurred on November 25, 2003, at the residence where Bhavna lived with Shashi Tripathi.
Anil Kumar, a 13-year-old servant and eyewitness, reported the incident to Dr. Sharda Prasad Tripathi, Bhavna's father-in-law, who subsequently filed an FIR.
