M/s Jain Industries was the original registered proprietor of the trademark in question. Thukral claimed to have become the proprietor of the trademark on May 30, 1986, through an assignment. The appellant filed a rectification application, asserting non-use of the trademark for a period exceeding five years. The Board dismissed the application, determining that the period of five years and one month began from the date Thukral became the proprietor, thus making the application premature. Conversely, the High Court found that M/s Jain Industries had not used the trademark at all, and Thukral's use lacked legal authorization from M/s Jain Industries, casting doubt on the bona fide use of the trademark.
