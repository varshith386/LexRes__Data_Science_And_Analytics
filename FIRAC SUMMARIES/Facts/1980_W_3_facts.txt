The case involves two civil appeals (No. 2300 and No. 2299 of 1979) concerning awards and corrections made by the Industrial Tribunal regarding wage revisions and dearness allowance for employees. The Tribunal initially made an award on December 20, 1978, and subsequently issued a correction on December 22, 1978, in response to an application from the employees' union seeking to clarify an alleged error in the award. The employer company did not object to the correction at that time. The appeals challenge the validity and correctness of both the original award and the subsequent correction.
