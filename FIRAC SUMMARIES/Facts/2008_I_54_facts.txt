The accused, a Sri Lankan student studying in India, was convicted by the Principal District Judge, Madurai, for the murder of Mayurani, another Sri Lankan student. The accused was sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine for the offence under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine for the offence under Section 392 read with Section 397 IPC. The occurrence allegedly took place on 22nd April 2003, and the First Information Report (FIR) was lodged by Solsimalai (PW-1) on 24th April 2003. Investigations led to the arrest of the accused on 26th April 2003, and several incriminating materials, including a knife and a log, were recovered based on the accusedâ€™s statements. The prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence, particularly the confessional statements of the accused leading to the recovery of these materials. The trial court found the accused guilty based on this evidence. However, the High Court acquitted the accused, finding the evidence insufficient to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The appellant (State) appealed this acquittal.
