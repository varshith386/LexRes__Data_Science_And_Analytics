Subbammal, a woman worker at Mount Stuart Estate, a plantation industry, took maternity leave starting from her expected delivery date in October 1967.
She was paid maternity benefit based on her average daily wage for 72 working days within twelve weeks, excluding twelve Sundays.
Dissatisfied, Subbammal claimed maternity benefit for the entire twelve weeks (84 days), arguing that Sundays should be included.
