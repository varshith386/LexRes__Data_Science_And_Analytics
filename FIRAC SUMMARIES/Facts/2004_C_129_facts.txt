The appeals involve a challenge to a judgment by the Madras High Court regarding the withdrawal of benefits extended to sugar mills as subsidy. The government had issued GOMS No. 989 dated 1/9/1988, which directed the discontinuance of purchase tax exemption retrospectively from 1/4/1988 for mills exceeding a specified ceiling over five years. This decision was based on files produced before the High Court, which were not originally pleaded or disclosed to the appellants during the proceedings.
