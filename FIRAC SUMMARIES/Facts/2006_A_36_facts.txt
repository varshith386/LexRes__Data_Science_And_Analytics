The appellant, managing director of M/s Sundesh Springs Private Limited, was detained under Section 3 of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA). His company, which exported alloy steel, allegedly misdeclared the value and description of exported goods using fake bills procured through Prabhjot Singh, who operated three firms. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) found that non-alloy steel was exported as alloy steel at inflated prices, with proceeds routed through hawala channels. Following searches, incriminating documents were recovered, and statements under Section 108 of the Customs Act were made by the appellant and Prabhjot Singh. The appellantâ€™s detention order was issued on April 5, 2005. He challenged this through a writ of habeas corpus, which was dismissed, and subsequently, a Letters Patent Appeal was also dismissed.
