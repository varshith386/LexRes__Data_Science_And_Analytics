The dispute revolves around compensation owed to M/s Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd. ("the Company") following the acquisition of its land by the Meerut Development Authority.
The Company, in heavy arrears, had its assets managed by a receiver appointed by the District Collector under the UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act.
Various legal proceedings ensued, including writ petitions challenging auction sales of the Company's land and disputes over compensation payments.
