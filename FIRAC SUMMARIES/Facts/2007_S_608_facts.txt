The appellants, Appasaheb and his mother Kadubai, were convicted under Section 304-B read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sentenced to seven years of rigorous imprisonment by the Sessions Judge, Aurangabad. The conviction was based on the alleged harassment and subsequent death of Bhimabai, Appasaheb's wife, who consumed poison on 15 September 1991. Bhimabai was the daughter of PW1 Tukaram and was married to Appasaheb for about two and a half years before her death. Initially treated well, Bhimabai later faced demands from the appellants for money from her parents to meet household expenses and purchase manure. Despite her parents' efforts to intervene, the harassment continued. On 15 September 1991, Bhimabai was found dead with froth coming out of her mouth, indicating poisoning. The post-mortem confirmed death by insecticide poisoning. The prosecution alleged that Bhimabai ended her life due to the appellants' harassment for dowry.
