The case involves the judicial review of the Indian government's price fixation for bulk drugs under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order. The manufacturers challenged the price notifications, arguing that the procedure adopted by the government was arbitrary and lacked transparency. They contended that the government did not disclose necessary information required for them to effectively seek a review of the price fixation. Several judicial precedents were referenced to support their claims, emphasizing the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness.
