Shri Achutananda Purohit, an advocate and intermediary of forest lands in the estate of Jujumura, challenged the compensation awarded under the Orissa Estates Abolition Act, 1951.
The estate vested in the state on April 1, 1960, and the issue revolved around the adequacy of compensation.
Multiple legal proceedings ensued, including appeals and revisions, culminating in the present appeals before the Supreme Court.
