The appellants, claiming tenancy of agricultural land (Survey No. 1251, 3 acres 11 gunthas) in Lingabahalli Village, Madhugiri Taluk, Karnataka, filed Form No. 7 before the Land Tribunal seeking a declaration of occupancy rights under the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1974. They asserted that they had been cultivating the land since 1968 on a wara basis, giving one-third of the food grains to respondent No. 4. They relied on RTC (Record of Rights, Tenancy, and Crops) entries to support their claim. Respondent No. 4 contested this, claiming the land was mortgaged to respondent No. 3 (Rajashankar) in 1968 and that after the mortgage period, the land was to be returned to him. He argued the appellants’ father was not a tenant but was allowed to cultivate the land under respondent No. 3’s supervision. The Land Tribunal initially granted occupancy rights to the appellants, which was upheld by the appellate authority. However, the High Court, in its revisional jurisdiction under Section 121A of the Act, set aside the concurrent findings, leading to the present appeal before the Supreme Court.
