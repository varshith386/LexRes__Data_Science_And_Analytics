The appellant, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and the respondent, Great Eastern Shipping Company Limited (GESC), entered into a time charter party agreement on May 6, 1997. The agreement was for hiring vessels for specified periods. Subsequently, the agreement was extended via an addendum. Despite the termination of the charter party on August 31, 1998, the vessel "Jag Praja" continued to be used by BPCL beyond the agreement period. BPCL and GESC had several communications regarding the extension and terms of the charter party, but no formal agreement was signed for the period after August 31, 1998. When GESC did not receive satisfactory responses or payments from BPCL, it initiated arbitration proceedings. The arbitral tribunal ruled it lacked jurisdiction, as the original agreement had expired. However, the Bombay High Court set aside this decision, asserting the tribunal had jurisdiction.
