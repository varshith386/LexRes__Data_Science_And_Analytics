The case involves an appeal by special leave against an order dated 13 July 2005 from the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court.
The appeal arises from a dispute over the ownership and mutation of certain land parcels in Lonavala, Pune district, Maharashtra.
The appellant's father was a displaced person from Pakistan who migrated during the partition and was allotted land under the Displaced Persons Compensation and Rehabilitation Act, 1954.
There are conflicting claims over the ownership and mutation entries between the appellant and respondents, involving multiple rounds of appeals and revisions.
The State Minister for Revenue passed an order on 18 October 2002, which was challenged in a writ petition dismissed by the High Court, and subsequently in a Letters Patent Appeal which was also dismissed.
