In the legal dispute involving the appellants, who are associated with the late Harshad Mehta, a series of contentions were raised regarding the attachment and disposal of their properties. The appellants argued that their properties should not be automatically attached solely based on their notification and that their individual liabilities should be assessed separately from the collective liabilities of the so-called "Harshad Mehta Group." They further contended that the custodian exaggerated their liabilities and did not provide sufficient evidence or allow proper inspection of documents. The Special Court had previously accepted the custodian’s figures without detailed analysis, leading to the appellants’ appeal for a re-evaluation.
