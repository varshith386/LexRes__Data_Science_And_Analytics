Dr. Kota Shivarama Karanth, a renowned Jnanapeeth awardee, developed a new form of Yakshagana, named Yaksha Ranga, during his tenure as director of an institute. In 1994, he executed a will naming Malini Mallya as the residuary legatee of his literary works, including seven Yaksharanga prasangas. Dr. Karanth passed away in 1997. Subsequently, a Yakshagana ballet as developed by Dr. Karanth was performed in New Delhi in 2001 without prior permission from Malini Mallya, who claimed copyright under Dr. Karanth's will.
