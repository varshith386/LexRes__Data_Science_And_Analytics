The appeal is against the Gujarat High Court's decision dated 28th February 1986.
The respondent, employed as a Technical Assistant with the Gujarat State Electricity Board, was promoted to Deputy Engineer.
He was transferred from Surat to Ukai but refused to join citing his mother's illness, leading to his discharge under Service Regulation No. 113 for unauthorized absence.
The High Court, through a writ petition, initially quashed the discharge but refused reinstatement or full back wages due to the respondent's conduct.
Both parties appealed to the Division Bench, which upheld the discharge as illegal but directed reinstatement with 50% back wages.
The appellant (Gujarat State Electricity Board) appealed to the Supreme Court.
