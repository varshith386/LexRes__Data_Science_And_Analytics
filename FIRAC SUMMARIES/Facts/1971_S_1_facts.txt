The case revolves around the acquisition of land for the Sirsa Airfield in 1963. The key parties involved include the appellant, who was in charge of the expansion work on the airstrip, Mr. Nagpal, the Additional Deputy Commissioner of Hissar, the Military Estates Officer Mr. K.K. Gamkhar, and the contractor, Telu Ram (P.W. 8). On February 1, 1963, symbolic possession of the land was given, with actual possession confirmed on February 13, 1963, when a bumper crop of sarson, gram, and lusan was standing on the land. However, the appellant delayed handing over the acquired land to the contractor until after March 23, 1963, during which time the crop was cut and removed without proper accounting, suggesting dishonest and fraudulent intent.
