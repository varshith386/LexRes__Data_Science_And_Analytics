Initial Incident: Mr. M.K. Verma, a junior engineer from the Civil Line Zone, discovered unauthorized construction at 189 Prem Gali, Punja Sharif, Mori Gate.
Legal Action: An FIR was filed based on Mr. Verma's report, leading to the issuance of a notice under Sections 343 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act (DMC Act) and subsequent prosecution of Gurcharan Singh and Kuldeep Singh under Sections 332 and 461 of the DMC Act.
Trial Court: The trial court convicted Gurcharan Singh and sentenced him to six months of simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5000.
Sessions Court: Gurcharan Singh’s appeal to the Sessions Court was dismissed, upholding the trial court’s decision.
High Court: Gurcharan Singh then filed a criminal revision petition before the High Court, which maintained his conviction but granted him probation under Section 4 of the Probation of Offenders Act (POB Act) and waived the fine and imprisonment, citing the prolonged trial period of 12 years and three days already spent in jail.
Supreme Court Appeal: The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) appealed to the Supreme Court, challenging the High Court's decision.
