The case involves a dispute over the ownership and production rights of the TV serial "Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi" between the petitioners (plaintiffs) and respondents (defendants). The petitioners claimed that the respondents produced the serial as their agents and sought ownership and copyright rights over it. They argued that agreements and bills indicated the respondents acted on their behalf. However, the trial court and subsequently the appellate court found that the respondents independently produced the serial without agency or ownership rights passing to the petitioners.
