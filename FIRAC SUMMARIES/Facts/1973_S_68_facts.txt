The appellant filed a suit in October 1942 against the State of Travancore (now Kerala) for recovery of Rs. 2 lakhs and interest, claiming wrongful dispossession from 160 acres of land with improvements.
The land in question was disputed between the appellant's family (occupants) and the Koodalvalli Illom (jenmi family) and the State of Travancore.
Appellant's father and appellant himself had made substantial improvements on the land under the belief it belonged to the Illom.
Disputes and legal actions regarding the land's ownership and possession had persisted over several decades.
