The case involves Respondent No. 1 and others accused of misappropriating funds through Vesco, allegedly making payments recorded in Vesco's account books but not in those of the purported recipients. The prosecution's evidence hinges on discrepancies between Vesco's records and those of Crompton Engineering Co., Lumin Electric Co., and others. An approver was granted pardon under Section 337 of the CrPC, but its validity was contested.
