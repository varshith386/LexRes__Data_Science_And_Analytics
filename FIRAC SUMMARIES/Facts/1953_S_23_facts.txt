Dwarka Nath Ghose, owner of considerable movable and immovable properties, executed his last will and testament on June 10, 1891. He dedicated two immovable properties (premises No. 41 and No. 401 Grey Street, Calcutta) to his family idol, Shree Shree Iswar Sridhar Jew. He appointed his two sons, Rajendra and Jogendra, as executors and specified that his second wife, Golap Sundari, along with Rajendra and Jogendra, would perform the seva (worship) of the deity. Upon their death, their heirs and successors would continue the seva. Dwarka Nath died on March 16, 1892, leaving behind his widow and two sons.

Rajendra made his will on July 19, 1899, confirming Dwarka Nath's dedication and appointing Jogendra as the executor. Rajendra died on January 31, 1900, and Jogendra obtained probate of both Rajendra's and Dwarka Nath's wills. Bhupendra, Jnanendra, and Nagendra, Rajendra’s sons, filed a suit (No. 969 of 1909) against Jogendra and others for the construction of the wills and partition. The idol was not a party to this suit. A consent decree on November 24, 1910, allotted portions of the properties to the different family branches. Jogendra died on August 5, 1911, leaving a will appointing his widow, Sushilabala, as executrix, who obtained probate on August 6, 1912.

Disputes between Bhupendra, Jnanendra, and Nagendra led to arbitration, resulting in an award on October 12, 1920, allotting premises No. 41A Grey Street to Nagendra, who then executed several mortgages and a deed of settlement, appointing trustees for the premises. Snehalata Dutt filed a suit (No. 1042 of 1929) for the realization of the mortgage security, resulting in a consent decree. The premises were sold in an auction in December 1936 and purchased by Hari Charan Dutt, Hari Pada Dutt, and Durga Charan Dutt.

Haripada Dutt’s sons (the appellants) obtained full title to the premises after further transactions. On July 19, 1948, the family idol, through its next friend Debabrata Ghosh, filed a suit against the appellants and others for a declaration of ownership of the premises and other reliefs. The trial court declared premises No. 41A Grey Street as the idol's absolute property but dismissed the claim regarding premises No. 402A Grey Street. The High Court dismissed the appellants' appeal and allowed the idol's cross-objections regarding a sum of Rs 19,000 but dismissed other cross-objections. The appellants obtained a certificate under Article 133(1) of the Constitution to appeal to the Supreme Court, which is the current appeal.
