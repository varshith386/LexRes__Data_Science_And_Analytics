Maharaj Shri Amar Singji Himatsingji was granted the Daljitgarh jagir comprising several villages by orders issued between 1933 and 1947 by the ruler of Idar.
The Bombay Merged Territories and Areas Jagirs Abolition Act, 1953 abolished his jagir, declaring him entitled to compensation under Section 11 of the Act.
An inquiry by the competent authority under Section 24(1) of the Act determined the jagir to be proprietary, implying ownership rights including the soil.
Subsequent disputes arose regarding the respondent's rights to mines and mineral products, particularly gravel and stones, prompting an inquiry under Section 37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code initiated by the Collector.
