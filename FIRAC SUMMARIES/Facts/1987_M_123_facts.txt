This appeal arises from a judgment concerning the acquisition of property initially settled by Sail Nawaz Jung in Mukkalla State, South Yemen, later requisitioned by the Military Estate Officer, Secunderabad, in 1963. Abdul Khader, claiming rights as a tenant, sought compensation under the Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952. Disputes arose regarding his status as a protected tenant under the Andhra Pradesh Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950. Various judicial proceedings ensued, including petitions and appeals challenging Abdul Khader's status as a protected tenant.
