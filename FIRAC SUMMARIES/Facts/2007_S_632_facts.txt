The State of Manipur appealed against a judgment by the Division Bench of the Guwahati High Court dated 29.07.2005, which upheld a prior judgment by a single judge dated 19.02.1999.
The case involves the appointments made by Shri A.J. Tayeng, Revenue Commissioner of Manipur, for the posts of Mandols, Process Servers, and Zilladars in 1997.
Manipur had no recruitment rules for these posts, and Tayeng was the cadre controlling authority.
The appointments were temporary and allegedly made without the knowledge of the state. No records were maintained for these appointments.
Tayeng denied making such appointments in a note dated 12.01.1998, blaming the Secretary Revenue, M.D. A.R. Khan, for unauthorized appointments.
Consequently, the appointments were canceled on 17.02.1998.
Despite Tayeng's initial denial, he later supported the respondents' case in an affidavit, affirming the authenticity of the appointment orders bearing his signature.
The respondents' writ petitions challenging the cancellation were allowed by a single judge, ruling that principles of natural justice were violated, and the cancellation orders were inconsistent and thus invalid.
The High Court, while allowing the writ petitions, left the door open for the state to take legal action against the respondents.
