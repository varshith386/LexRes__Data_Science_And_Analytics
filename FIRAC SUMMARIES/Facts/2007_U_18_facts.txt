On November 10, 2002, Mukhtiar Kaur was found dead with gunshot injuries at Ujjagar Singh's house, while Singh himself was found unconscious with a gunshot injury.
Mukhtiar Kaur, the niece of Ujjagar Singh, was living with him due to strained relations with her in-laws. There was a dispute over agricultural land transferred by Kaur's deceased father's wife to Singh's sons.
Ujjagar Singh was convicted by the Additional Sessions Judge for the murder of Mukhtiar Kaur, sentenced to death, and also convicted under Section 376 (rape) and Section 309 (attempted suicide) of the IPC. The High Court upheld these convictions and sentences.
