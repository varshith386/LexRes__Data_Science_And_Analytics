The appellants were employed by the respondent, Indore Development Authority, for a project financed by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA). They were later put on a monthly salary and were included in the provident fund, given leave benefits, employment codes, and included in a seniority list.
The project ended on June 30, 1997, and the maintenance was taken over by the Indore Municipal Corporation.
The appellants claimed they should be regularized as permanent employees and argued their case before the Labour Court, which decided in their favor. The respondent appealed, leading to the High Court reversing the decision. The appellants then appealed to the Supreme Court.
