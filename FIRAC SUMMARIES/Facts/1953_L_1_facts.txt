Lakshminarayana Iyer, a Hindu Brahmin, executed a will on November 16, 1924. He left behind significant property in the Tirunelveli District, survived by his widow, Ranganayaki, and his married daughter, Ramalakshmi. The will directed that Ranganayaki should enjoy the properties during her lifetime, and after her death, Ramalakshmi and her heirs should enjoy the properties with absolute rights. The will also provided for the maintenance of Chinnanmal alias Lakshmi Ammal, the widow of Iyer's deceased son, Hariharamayyan. Ranganayaki took possession of the properties and settled Lakshmi Ammal's maintenance claim in 1928. Ramalakshmi died in 1938 without surviving children. In 1945, Ranganayaki sold some of the property, leading to the current suit by the plaintiff, Ramalakshmi's husband, against the defendants. The plaintiff contends that the sale is not binding beyond the widowâ€™s lifetime and seeks to restrain further alienation of the properties. The defendants argue that the plaintiff has no title to maintain the suit and that Ranganayaki had an absolute estate or at least an estate analogous to a Hindu widow's estate, making Ramalakshmi's interest contingent.
