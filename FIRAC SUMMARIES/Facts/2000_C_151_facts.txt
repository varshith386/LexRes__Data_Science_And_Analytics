The case involves a dispute regarding the establishment of an engineering college by the appellant, where approval was granted by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) under its regulations. Subsequently, the Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala, included the appellant in the list of affiliated colleges for the academic year 1995-96 based on the AICTE's approval. However, the State Government of Kerala refused to grant its approval, citing reasons such as the need to assess infrastructure and employment opportunities.
