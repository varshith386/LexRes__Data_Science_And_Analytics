The case involves multiple petitions challenging the application of a scheme established in J.P. Unni Krishnan v. State of A.P. (1993), concerning admissions to professional courses in minority educational institutions.
A Constitution Bench in October 1993 referred three key questions to a larger bench for consideration.
On March 16, 1994, the court re-framed the questions to address claims of minority status based on religion or language and the status of minority educational institutions.
The court issued interim orders for admissions in the academic sessions to ensure continuity pending final adjudication.
