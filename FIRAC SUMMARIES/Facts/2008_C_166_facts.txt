Background:

The appellant filed a writ appeal under Section 21 of the M.P. Uchacha Nyayalay (Khand Nyaypeeth Ko Appeal) Adhiniyam, 2005.
The appeal challenged an order passed by a learned single judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court on 9-11-2005.
The single judge's order was in exercise of the power of superintendence under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
The writ petition aimed to quash an order by the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Tax, levying purchase and entry tax.
Procedural History:

The single judge's order was contested through a Special Leave Petition (SLP), which the Supreme Court disposed of on 16-2-2006, granting the appellant three weeks to file a Letters Patent Appeal (LPA).
The Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court dismissed the writ appeal as not maintainable, interpreting the Supreme Court's order as only waiving the limitation period for filing the LPA, not directing a merits review.
