The appellant is a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, engaged in manufacturing and selling cigarettes.
Respondent No. 1 filed a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution seeking a writ of mandamus to treat canteen workers as employees of the appellant and grant them benefits.
The canteen is provided on the factory premises as per Section 46 of the Factories Act, 1948, which mandates canteens for factories with over 250 workers.
Appellant contends that it engaged contractors to manage the canteen and therefore workers are not its employees.
