The court held that a further inquiry under Section 37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code regarding the respondent's rights to mines and mineral products was competent.
The Collector's inquiry under Section 372 of the Code was quashed as the respondent had not made a valid claim as required by the section.
The appeal by the State of Gujarat and the Collector was dismissed, affirming the Gujarat High Court's decision to quash the Collector's order and issue an injunction against further inquiries under Section 372 of the Code.
