The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' decisions, dismissing the appeal. It held that the appellant was not entitled to compensation for the improvements made on the land, including the trees planted, due to his lack of bona fide possession and the absence of legal grounds under Section 9 of the Act. The appeal was dismissed with costs recovered from the appellant.
