The appeal was allowed, and the appellants were acquitted of the charge under Section 304-B IPC due to the lack of evidence proving a demand for dowry as defined by the Dowry Prohibition Act. The judgment and order of the High Court and the Sessions Judge convicting the appellants were set aside. Appellant No. 1, who was in custody, was ordered to be released forthwith unless wanted in another case, and Appellant No. 2, who was on bail, had her sureties and bail bonds discharged.
