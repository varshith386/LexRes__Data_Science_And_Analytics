The appeals are partially allowed. The Supreme Court set aside the IPABâ€™s order dated September 9, 2004, and restored the applications to the IPAB for fresh consideration. The IPAB is instructed to re-evaluate the applications in light of the observations made regarding the locus standi of the first respondent and other pertinent issues. Both parties are to bear their own costs. The court did not delve into the merits of the contentions, leaving them open for argument before the IPAB.
