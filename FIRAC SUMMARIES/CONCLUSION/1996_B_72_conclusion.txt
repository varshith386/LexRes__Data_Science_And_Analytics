The Calcutta High Court erred in directing the Receiver to hand over possession of Nalban Fishery to the Sarkar family, as the State's rights were not affected by the compromise decree or subsequent orders. The appeals are allowed, the injunction against Bansilal Farms is vacated, and the State is directed to determine and pay compensation to the Sarkar family in accordance with applicable laws for their interest in Nalban Fishery. No costs are awarded.
