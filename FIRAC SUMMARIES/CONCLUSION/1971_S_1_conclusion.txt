The trial court and the high court found that the appellant, entrusted with the land for the airstrip expansion, acted dishonestly and fraudulently by allowing the crops to be cut and taken away without proper accounting. The courts' concurrent findings led to the dismissal of the appeal, upholding the appellant's conviction under Section 5(1)(c) read with Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
