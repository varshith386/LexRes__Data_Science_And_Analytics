The Supreme Court dismissed the appeals, upholding the High Court's decision that the appellants were not entitled to be regularized as permanent employees. The appointments were project-specific, and the necessary statutory requirements for permanency were not met. Consequently, the doctrine of 'equal pay for equal work' does not apply, and the appellants' claim lacks merit. No costs were awarded.
