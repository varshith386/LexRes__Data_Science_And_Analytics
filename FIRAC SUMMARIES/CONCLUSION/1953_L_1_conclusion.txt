The trial court and the High Court concluded that Ranganayaki had a limited life estate, not an absolute estate. The Supreme Court affirmed this decision, determining that the widow did not have a full Hindu widowâ€™s estate but a limited life estate, confirming that Ramalakshmi had a vested interest, and thus, the plaintiff had the right to challenge the alienations.
