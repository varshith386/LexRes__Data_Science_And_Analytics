The court upheld the decision of the High Court, ruling that maternity benefit under the Maternity Benefits Act, 1961 should include Sundays falling within the period of absence preceding and following the delivery day. The appeal was dismissed, affirming that Subbammal was entitled to maternity benefit for all 84 days, inclusive of Sundays. Costs were awarded to the respondent due to the appellant's failure to appear, with additional compensation directed to the amicus curiae for valuable assistance.
