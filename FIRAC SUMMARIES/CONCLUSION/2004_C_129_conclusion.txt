The Supreme Court remitted the matter to the High Court for reconsideration:

The government should file counter-affidavits within six weeks justifying the withdrawal of benefits.
The High Court should reconsider the legality of retrospective withdrawal and the applicability of doctrines like promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation.
The undisclosed materials and lack of opportunity for hearing violate principles of natural justice, requiring fair consideration of the appellants' claims.
Thus, the appeals were disposed of, and the matter was remanded to the High Court for fresh consideration on the specified issues without costs.
