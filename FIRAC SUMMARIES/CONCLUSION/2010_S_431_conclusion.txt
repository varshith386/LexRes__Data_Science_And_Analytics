Remand for Retrial: The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction, and remitted the case for a new trial. The trial court is directed to frame a new charge specifying Sheela Devi as the victim. The appellant's conviction was overturned due to the material error in the charge that led to a failure of justice.
