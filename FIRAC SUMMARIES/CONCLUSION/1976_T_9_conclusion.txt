The Supreme Court affirmed the High Court's decision to remand the case for fresh assessment of compensation, emphasizing compliance with statutory appraisal procedures. It dismissed appeals, directing completion of proceedings within six months and ordered parties to bear their own costs. The judgment clarified the legal framework for compensation under the Orissa Estates Abolition Act, 1951, settling several procedural and substantive issues raised by the appellant.
