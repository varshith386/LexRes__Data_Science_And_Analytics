The Supreme Court concluded that the High Courtâ€™s decision to extend the benefit of probation to Gurcharan Singh was procedurally flawed due to the absence of a conduct report and the non-disclosure of a prior conviction. The judgment impugned in the appeal was set aside, and the case was remitted to the High Court for fresh disposal in accordance with the law. The respondent was ordered to pay costs of Rs. 10,000 to the appellant (MCD).
