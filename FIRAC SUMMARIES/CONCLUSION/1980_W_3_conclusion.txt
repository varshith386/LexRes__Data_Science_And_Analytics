The Supreme Court concluded that:

The correction made by the Tribunal on December 22, 1978, was within its jurisdiction and did not constitute a fresh award. Hence, Civil Appeal No. 2299 of 1979 should be dismissed in its entirety.
The appeal filed by the workmen (Civil Appeal No. 2300 of 1979) should also be dismissed as the tribunal had given satisfactory reasons for its decisions regarding dearness allowance, and no illegality warranting interference was committed.
