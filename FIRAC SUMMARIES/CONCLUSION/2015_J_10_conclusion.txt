The Supreme Court upheld the conviction of the second appellant under Section 307 IPC but reduced the sentence from five years to three years, in addition to ordering a compensation of Rs. 750,000 to be paid to the injured Sukhbir.
The conviction of other appellants under Section 325 and Section 323 IPC was confirmed with a reduction in sentence to the period already undergone.
The court emphasized the need for appropriate sentencing based on the gravity of the offense and the circumstances of the case.
The appeal was partly allowed, and directions were given for the release of the appellant and the settlement of compensation.
