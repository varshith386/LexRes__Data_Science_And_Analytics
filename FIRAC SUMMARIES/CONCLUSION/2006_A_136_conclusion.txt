The Supreme Court directed the Special Court to:

Reconsider the appellants' individual liabilities separately from the collective liabilities of the "Harshad Mehta Group."
Allow the appellants to inspect all relevant documents and present their case afresh.
Reassess the appellants' tax liabilities in light of subsequent appellate decisions and principles established in previous judgments.
Proceed with the confirmation of the auction sales of commercial properties and reconsider the sale of residential properties based on the revised assessment of liabilities.
