In conclusion, the Supreme Court held that the State Government's invocation of emergency provisions under Section 17(4) was unjustified given the lack of genuine urgency. It quashed the notifications under Sections 4 and 6 of the Act relating to the appellants' lands, affirming their right under Section 5A to a fair opportunity to object to the acquisition. The Court emphasized that public interest must be balanced with procedural fairness, ensuring that land acquisition for public purposes does not unduly infringe upon landowners' rights. Therefore, the appeals were allowed, and no costs were awarded.

This judgment underscores the judiciary's role in ensuring that administrative actions, even those ostensibly for public interest, comply meticulously with statutory requirements and constitutional principles of justice and fairness.
