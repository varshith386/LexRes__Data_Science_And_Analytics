The Supreme Court affirmed the High Court's decision, holding that:

The leasehold of a tenant does not merge into mortgage security.
Civil courts must refer tenancy issues under the BTAL Act to the Mamlatdar.
Therefore, the appeal by the plaintiff is dismissed, and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with the Mamlatdar's findings on tenancy.
