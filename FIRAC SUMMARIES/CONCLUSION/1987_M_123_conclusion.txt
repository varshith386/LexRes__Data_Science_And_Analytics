The appeal is dismissed. The High Court correctly upheld the arbitrator's decision that Abdul Khader qualifies as a protected tenant entitled to 60% of the compensation for the acquired property. The court emphasized that while revenue authorities' findings are significant, they do not preclude arbitration under the central act for determining compensation. Therefore, Abdul Khader's entitlement to compensation as a protected tenant was validly established under the circumstances of the case.
