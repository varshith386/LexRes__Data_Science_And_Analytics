Based on the analysis of circumstantial evidence:

The Supreme Court concludes that the prosecution failed to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
The circumstantial evidence presented, including recovery of stained clothes and inquiries by the accused, does not form a conclusive chain pointing exclusively to the accused's guilt.
Therefore, the conviction under Sections 302 and 376(2)(f) IPC is set aside, and the accused Subhash is acquitted of all charges.
He is to be released immediately unless detained in connection with any other offense.
