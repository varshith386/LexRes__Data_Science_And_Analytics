The Supreme Court found that the delay in issuing the detention order was not satisfactorily explained, relevant documents were not placed before the detaining authority, and the appellant was not supplied with material documents, impairing his right to effective representation. Additionally, the detaining authority did not genuinely apply its mind. Consequently, the judgment of the High Court was set aside, and the detention order was quashed. The appeal was allowed, and the appellant was released from detention.
