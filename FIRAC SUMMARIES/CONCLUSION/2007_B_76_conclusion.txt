The High Court ruled that the arbitration clause remained effective, as the conduct of the parties implied an extension of the charter party. The arbitral tribunal had jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes arising from the period after the original contract expired. The court's decision to constitute a new arbitral tribunal for adjudicating the disputes was upheld, and the appeal was dismissed. The registry was directed to communicate this order to the newly constituted arbitral tribunal for expeditious resolution.
