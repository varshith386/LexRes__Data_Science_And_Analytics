The appeal was allowed, and the case remanded to the High Court for further review. The High Court was directed to re-evaluate the evidence in accordance with the Supreme Court's findings on the validity of the pardon, the reliability of the approver's testimony, and the admissibility of documentary evidence. The prosecution was advised to focus its case on select charges to streamline the proceedings.
