The High Court erred in dismissing the LPA on the grounds of non-maintainability.
The Supreme Courtâ€™s prior order intended the High Court to review the LPA on merits.
Given the nature of the relief sought in the writ petition, it should have been treated under Article 226, thus making the LPA maintainable.
The Supreme Court set aside the impugned order and directed the Division Bench to hear the writ appeal on merits.
