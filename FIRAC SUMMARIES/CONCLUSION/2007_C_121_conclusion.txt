The Court dismissed the appeals, holding that retrospective registration of the "Caltex" trademark did not confer exemption benefits under excise law due to the appellant's wrongful use of another's trademark. The judgment clarified that while registration under the Trade Marks Act facilitates legal benefits, it does not condone or rectify unauthorized use of trademarks in other regulatory contexts. The decision reaffirmed the distinction between legal registration and lawful use of trademarks in India, emphasizing compliance with both trademark and excise laws for entitlement to regulatory benefits.
