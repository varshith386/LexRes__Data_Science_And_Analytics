The High Courtâ€™s decision to acquit the accused was based on a careful evaluation of the circumstantial evidence and the procedural lapses in the investigation. The prosecution could not establish an unbroken chain of evidence linking the accused to the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed, and the acquittal was upheld.
