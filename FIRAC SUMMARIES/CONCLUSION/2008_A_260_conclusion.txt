The appeal filed by Span Diagnostics Limited on 19.10.2006 was maintainable in the High Court under the prevailing legal framework at the time. The subsequent changes in the Patents Act, 1970, and their staggered implementation did not retroactively invalidate appeals filed under the previous provisions. The High Court's jurisdiction remained valid until the new appellate provisions (Section 117A) came into force on 02.04.2007.
