The High Court's judgment, which found that non-use by M/s Jain Industries and questioned Thukral's bona fide use, is valid. The interpretation of "for the time being" in Section 46(1)(b) should include non-use by both the current and previous proprietors. The Board's initial dismissal of the rectification application was incorrect. The case is remitted back to the Board for a fresh determination, considering the legal principles of bona fide use and non-use by both the original and current proprietors. The appeal is allowed, and costs are assessed at Rs 100,000.
