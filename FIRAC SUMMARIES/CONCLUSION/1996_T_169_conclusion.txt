The appeal was dismissed. The court affirmed that the High Court's exercise of discretion in refusing to rectify the trademarks was correct. The appellant's continuous use under agreements with Sen Raleigh constituted bona fide use, and special circumstances were not proven to excuse non-use by the respondents. Therefore, the trademarks were not to be struck off from the register.
