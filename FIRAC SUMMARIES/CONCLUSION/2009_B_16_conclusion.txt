The courts upheld Malini Mallya's copyright in the Yaksharanga prasangas and the Yakshagana form developed by Dr. Karanth. They found that the defendants' performance in New Delhi without permission constituted copyright infringement. The injunction against further performances was affirmed, with modifications to allow performances falling under fair dealing provisions of the Copyright Act, 1957. The appeal was dismissed with no costs awarded.
