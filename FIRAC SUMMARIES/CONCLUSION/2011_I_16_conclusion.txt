After considering the facts, issues, and legal principles, the court concluded that the appeal lacked merit. It upheld the decision of the trial court, dismissing the appeal and canceling the appellant's bail. The court directed the trial court to enforce the remaining period of the appellant's sentence. Thus, the appellant's plea for leniency under Article 142 was rejected, affirming the stringent approach towards corruption cases involving public servants.
