The appeal is dismissed. The Supreme Court holds that:

The dedication of premises No. 41 Grey Street was absolute.
Nagendra’s possession of the premises was not adverse to the idol, and the idol’s title was not extinguished.
The High Court’s judgment regarding the sum of Rs 19,000 stands unchallenged.
The appellants' contentions are rejected, and the decision in favor of the idol is upheld. The appellants are to bear the costs.
