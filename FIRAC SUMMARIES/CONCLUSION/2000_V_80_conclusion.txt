The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal challenging the High Court's decision. It affirmed that the appellant's control and supervision over the canteen workers established an employer-employee relationship.
It clarified that the appellant, despite being a private company, was performing a public duty under Section 46 of the Factories Act, 1948, which obligated it to provide and maintain a canteen.
Therefore, the writ of mandamus was deemed appropriate in this case, and the workers were entitled to employment benefits as determined by the Industrial Tribunal.
