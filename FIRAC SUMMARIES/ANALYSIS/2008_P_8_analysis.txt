Non-Use Period Calculation: The Board's calculation that the five-year period started from May 30, 1986, was challenged by the High Court, which emphasized that non-use by the original proprietor (M/s Jain Industries) should also be considered. This raises the question of whether the assignment to Thukral resets the non-use period.

Bona Fide Use: The High Court questioned the legality of Thukral’s use without explicit consent from M/s Jain Industries, suggesting it was not bona fide. Bona fide use is essential to retain trademark rights, and unauthorized use without the original proprietor’s consent cannot be considered genuine.

Interpretation of "For the Time Being": The phrase should be interpreted to cover non-use by both the current and previous proprietors to prevent circumvention of the Act by simply assigning the trademark to reset the non-use period.

Jurisdiction and Procedure: The Board's dismissal of the application based on the timing of the assignment did not adequately address the issues of bona fide use and the proper calculation of the non-use period. The High Court's decision to set aside this dismissal was rooted in ensuring thorough examination of these factors.
