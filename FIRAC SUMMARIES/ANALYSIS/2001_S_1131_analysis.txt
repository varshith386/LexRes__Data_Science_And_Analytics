Last Seen Together: Testimony of a child witness about the accused taking the victim into his house lacks corroborative evidence and clarity, failing to establish their last seen together conclusively.
Abnormal Conduct: Inquiry about punishment for rape and murder by the accused does not conclusively prove criminal intent but could indicate nervousness under interrogation.
Recovery of Clothes: Underwear stained with semen and blood group B found based on accused's information raises doubts due to lack of evidence linking clothes to the accused or exclusion of other possible sources of stains.
False Plea of Alibi: Accused's denial of being on leave from work does not constitute a valid plea of alibi, undermining its significance as incriminating evidence.
Absconding: Lack of concrete evidence of accused's absconding post-incident weakens its status as incriminating evidence.
