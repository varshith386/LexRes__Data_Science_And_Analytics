The Supreme Court, while disposing of appeals related to the partition suit, explicitly protected the State's rights over fisheries from being affected by the compromise decree. The State had requisitioned Nalban Fishery under the West Bengal Land Requisition and Acquisition Act, 1948, and had possession since November 8, 1969. The Receiver, initially appointed to take possession, erroneously assumed control, which was corrected by a subsequent Receiver acknowledging the State's continuous possession. Judicial directions subsequently issued, including an injunction order and a demarcation directive, did not alter the State's statutory rights under the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, which defines land to include tank fisheries.
