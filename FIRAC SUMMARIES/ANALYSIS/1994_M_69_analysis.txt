Issue 1: Leasehold does not merge into mortgage security when the landlord mortgages the property to the tenant. No surrender of possession occurred prior to the mortgages.
Issue 2: Civil court's jurisdiction is ousted when a tenancy issue under the BTAL Act is raised. The High Court rightly remanded the case for a determination of tenancy status by the Mamlatdar.
