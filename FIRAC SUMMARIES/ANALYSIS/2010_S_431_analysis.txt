Trial and Conviction: The trial court convicted the appellant under Sections 452 and 354 IPC, sentencing him to six months' rigorous imprisonment and a fine. The appellate court upheld the conviction but reduced the sentence to four months.
Evidence:
Prakashi Devi's Testimony: The appellant did not touch or abuse her; her son Mahavir was present when the appellant first entered.
Sheela Devi's Testimony: The appellant touched her hand, causing her to raise an alarm.
Defense Witness: Suggested a false case due to a prior quarrel between the appellant and Prakashi Devi's son.
Court's Consideration:
Error in Charge: The charge mentioned outraging the modesty of Prakashi Devi, but the evidence indicated it was Sheela Devi.
Impact of Error: The appellant defended against the charge concerning Prakashi Devi and was not prepared to defend against a charge concerning Sheela Devi.
Legal Principles: Following the principles in Willie Slaney, Gurbachan Singh, and other cases, the court must ensure a fair trial and consider whether the error in the charge caused substantial prejudice.
