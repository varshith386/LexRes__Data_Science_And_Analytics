The Supreme Court discussed the scope of Article 226 and cited precedents like Anadi Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee Vandas Swami Suvarna Jayanti Mahotsav Smarak Trust to interpret the term "authority" broadly.
It examined whether the appellant's provision of a canteen constituted a public duty. It considered the appellant's control over the canteen operations, including menu, quality, and infrastructure.
The Court noted the long-term employment of workers despite changes in contractors and the appellant's provision of benefits like ESI and Provident Fund contributions.
It reviewed the High Court's decision in light of these factors and concluded that the appellant's control over the canteen workers indicated an employer-employee relationship, despite contractual arrangements.
