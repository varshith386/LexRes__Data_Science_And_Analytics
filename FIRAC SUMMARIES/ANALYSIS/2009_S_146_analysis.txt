FIR Recording Justification: The delay in FIR registration was explained due to poor visibility at the scene, necessitating the relocation of witnesses to ensure accurate recording, thus justifying the timing of FIR registration.
Eyewitness Testimony: Despite minor discrepancies, the consistent narrative of eyewitnesses and their relation to the deceased enhances the credibility of their testimony.
Legal Categorization of Offense: Evaluating the accused's actions against IPC Sections 299 and 300 reveals a lack of clear intent to cause death, indicating a charge under Section 304 Part II may be more appropriate than murder.
