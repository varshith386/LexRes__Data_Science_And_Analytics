The key contention revolves around the interpretation of the term "week" in the context of calculating maternity benefits. The appellant argued that since Sundays are non-working wageless holidays, they should be excluded from the computation of maternity benefit. However, the court analyzed various definitions and interpretations of the term "week" from legal dictionaries and concluded that for the purpose of maternity benefits under the Act, a "week" includes Sundays. This interpretation aligns with the legislative intent to provide comprehensive support to women during maternity, encompassing all days of the week including non-working wageless holidays.
