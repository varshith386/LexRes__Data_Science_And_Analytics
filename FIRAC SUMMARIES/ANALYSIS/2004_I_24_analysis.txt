The appellants were hired for a specific project and not as permanent employees. There was no evidence of issuing a permanent employee ticket, which is necessary for claiming permanency.
The seniority list and other benefits (provident fund, leave, employment codes) do not establish permanent status. They were employed as daily wagers without sanctioned posts.
The Labour Court overstepped its jurisdiction by granting relief beyond the scope of the reference made by the state government. It lacked the authority to regularize the appellants without compliance with statutory provisions.
Previous rulings establish that project-based employment does not grant permanent rights once the project concludes. The appellants failed to prove continuous work for 240 days in a year, a requirement for claiming certain employment benefits.
The plea for 'equal pay for equal work' is invalid as the appellants did not hold regular posts or undergo standard recruitment processes. The responsibilities and nature of their work were not comparable to regular employees.
