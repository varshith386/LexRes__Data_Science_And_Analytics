The prosecution relied primarily on the testimony of Anil Kumar, who identified the accused during trial and provided details of the crime.
Anil Kumar's testimony was scrutinized for reliability, considering his age and potential influence by the police, but no evidence of tutoring was found.
Identification parades were conducted soon after the arrests, minimizing the possibility of mistaken identity or unfair procedures.
The court evaluated whether the accused had a common intention to commit murder, examining each accused's role and their actions before, during, and after the crime.
The court found sufficient evidence to convict Shashi Tripathi, Raju Devendra Choubey, and Binu Chandra Prakash, but acquitted Mahesh due to lack of evidence linking him directly to the crime or common intention.
