The trial court found that:

The respondents initiated production independently before formal involvement of the petitioners.
Agreements and bills did not establish agency or transfer of ownership.
Doordarshan recognized the respondents as producers and the petitioners as sponsors.
Payments made by the petitioners were fixed sponsorship fees, not production costs.
The appellate court affirmed these findings, noting inconsistencies in the petitioners' claims and the evidence presented.
