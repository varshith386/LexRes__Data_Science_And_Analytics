The court examined whether the determination that the jagir was proprietary under Section 24(1) of the Act implied entitlement to mines and mineral products.
It was determined that the inquiry under Section 24(1) focused on the nature of the jagir (proprietary or non-proprietary) and did not inherently decide rights to mines and mineral products.
The respondent's applications did not constitute a valid claim under Section 372 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code as they merely sought to record rights already acknowledged, not asserting new claims.
The court noted that the determination of proprietary nature did not automatically imply rights to mines and mineral products unless specifically included in the grant.
