Possession of Land and Crops:

The appellant received actual possession of the acquired land on February 13, 1963, with standing crops.
Despite this, he denied the existence of these crops, contradicting credible documentary evidence.
Delay in Handing Over Land:

The appellant delayed handing over the land to the contractor until after March 23, 1963.
During this period, the crops were cut and taken away without proper accounting.
Testimonies and Documentary Evidence:

Witnesses, including the contractor and P.W. 11 (Sukhchain Lal Jain), confirmed the presence of crops and the delay in handing over the land.
The appellant's letters and other documentary evidence highlighted the issues regarding the alignment and possession of the land, reinforcing the prosecution's case.
Contradictory Statements:

The appellant's denial of the crops' existence on February 13, 1963, despite overwhelming evidence, further indicated fraudulent intent.
