Supreme Court's Order:

The Supreme Courtâ€™s order dated 22-8-2006 explicitly directed the High Court to consider the LPA on merits if filed within the stipulated period and free from defects.
The High Court misinterpreted this order by concluding it only pertained to waiving the limitation period.
Nature of Relief Sought in the Writ Petition:

The writ petition primarily sought to quash an assessment order, which typically falls under Article 226.
The High Court's focus on the petition's labeling under Article 227 was misplaced, as it should have considered the nature of the relief and controversy involved.
Precedents on Maintainability:

Case law supports the maintainability of an appeal where the relief sought falls under Article 226, even if ancillary orders pertain to Article 227.
The determining factor is the substance of the relief sought, not merely the procedural label.
