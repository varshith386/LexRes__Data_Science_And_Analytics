The court analyzed the appellant's plea for reducing the sentence in light of the above rules and legal principles. It referred to several precedents where the Supreme Court had clarified the scope and limitations of Article 142. The court emphasized that while the article provides wide discretionary powers, these should not be used to undermine statutory provisions or prescribe sentences below the statutory minimum, especially in cases of corruption by public servants.
