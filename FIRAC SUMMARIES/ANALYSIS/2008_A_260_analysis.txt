Timing and Validity of Appeal:

On 23.08.2006, the Controller rejected Span Diagnostics Limitedâ€™s pre-grant opposition. At that time, an appeal to the High Court was valid under the existing Section 116 of the Patents Act, 1970.
The amendments introduced by the Patents Amendment Act, 2005, which provided for post-grant opposition and restricted appeals to the Appellate Board, were not fully in force until 02.04.2007.
Legislative Intent and Staggered Implementation:

The staggered implementation of the amendments created confusion regarding the appropriate appellate forum.
Although the structural change in the opposition process was effective from 01.01.2005, the provision for appeal to the Appellate Board (Section 117A) was not effective until 02.04.2007.
Impact on Pending Appeals:

Given that the specific sections providing for the Appellate Board's jurisdiction were not in force when the appeal was filed, the High Court remained the appropriate forum under the transitional provisions.
