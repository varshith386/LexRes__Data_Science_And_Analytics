Jurisdiction of Compensation Officer: Rejected the argument that jurisdiction expired post-vesting, emphasizing statutory provisions allow post-vesting compensation calculation.
Appraisal Process: Found Chief Conservator's independent appraisal without following forest officer's report to be erroneous, reaffirming the necessity of statutory compliance.
Admissibility of Evidence: Rejected certain evidentiary objections raised by appellant regarding the Chief Conservator's report.
Calculation Methodology: Dismissed challenges to the slab system and rejected inflation adjustment arguments, citing constitutional provisions and legislative intent.
Interest Calculation: Upheld statutory rate over appellant's claim for higher interest, citing legislative prerogative.
