The designated court erroneously concluded that the appellants committed an offence under Section 3 of TADA based solely on the fact that the victims belonged to the Wadar community. The court found no evidence or motive indicating an intention on the part of the appellants to strike terror within a particular community. Therefore, the conviction under Section 3 of TADA was set aside.
