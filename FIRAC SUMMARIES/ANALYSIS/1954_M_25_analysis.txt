Both the Industrial Court and Labour Appellate Tribunal confirmed a trading loss of Rs. 5,02,563 1 anna 10 paise for 1949.
Dividend distribution was made from reserves and not from 1949 profits.
The Labour Appellate Tribunal considered social justice in its decision, despite the trading loss.
Bonus linked to dividends would create complications, as dividends can be manipulated by the company.
Workers do not have a right to reserves or undistributed profits since they are not members of the company and the labour force is not constant year-to-year.
The principle of distributing bonus only when profits are made was upheld, as a loss negates the basis for bonus claims.
Social justice considerations were deemed irrelevant and inappropriate by the Court, emphasizing that fairness must be based on solid principles and not arbitrary adjudicator discretion.
