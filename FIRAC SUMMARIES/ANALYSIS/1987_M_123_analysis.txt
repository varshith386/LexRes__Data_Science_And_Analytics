The High Court and the arbitrator determined Abdul Khader's status as a protected tenant despite conflicting findings by revenue authorities. They relied on interpretations of Sections 34 and 37 of the Andhra Pradesh Act, which define conditions for protected tenancy. The courts held that while the revenue authorities' determinations are relevant, they do not conclusively bar the arbitrator from deciding compensation under the central act. The High Court affirmed the arbitrator's decision based on evidence presented regarding Abdul Khader's historical tenancy.
