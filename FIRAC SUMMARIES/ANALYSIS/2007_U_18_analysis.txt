Prosecution Evidence: The prosecution's case rested on circumstantial evidence including the presence of Singh and Kaur alone at the scene, the recovery of Singh's licensed gun, and forensic reports linking the spent cartridges to Singh's gun.
Defense: Singh claimed he was attacked by an unknown assailant and was unconscious, making him unaware of Kaur’s murder.
Court’s Findings: The court found the circumstantial evidence sufficient, despite hostile witnesses and discrepancies in the prosecution's case.

Medical Evidence: Semen was found on the vaginal swabs and Kaur’s underwear.
Court’s Reasoning: There was no evidence proving the intercourse was non-consensual. No injuries indicating force or struggle were found on Kaur’s body.
Conclusion: The conviction under Section 376 IPC was not sustained due to lack of evidence showing non-consensual intercourse.

Injury Analysis: Singh’s injury was consistent with a self-inflicted gunshot. The forensic evidence supported that the shot was fired from close range.
Prosecution’s Argument: Singh’s gunshot wound lacked charring, typically expected in a close-range shot. However, this was countered by medical testimony stating that burnt tissue had been removed during treatment.
Conclusion: The court upheld the conviction under Section 309 IPC.
