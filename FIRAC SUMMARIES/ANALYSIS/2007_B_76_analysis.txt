The key issue was whether the arbitration clause from the original charter party, which formally expired on August 31, 1998, continued to be effective due to the conduct of the parties. The appellant argued that the arbitration clause expired with the contract, while the respondent contended that the continued use of the vessel under the same terms (except the hire rate) implied the extension of the charter party.

The High Court found that:

The vessel "Jag Praja" continued to be used by BPCL without redelivery, indicating that the original terms, including the arbitration clause, still applied.
The appellant's silence and continued use of the vessel after the contract expiration suggested acceptance of the respondent's terms sub silentio (by silence).
Clauses 4 and 23 of the charter party indicated that the contract's terms continued until the vessel was formally redelivered.
The arbitration agreement was not extinguished by the expiration of the charter party as the vessel was not redelivered and the terms continued to govern the relationship.
