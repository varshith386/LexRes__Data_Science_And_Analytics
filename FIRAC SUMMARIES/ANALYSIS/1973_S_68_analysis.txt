The trial court and the High Court concluded that the appellant's possession was not bona fide, as evidenced by his attempts to obtain registration and involvement in legal disputes over the land's ownership.
The appellant's claim for compensation for trees was rejected, as trees were deemed not to fall under the category of "other product raised on the land" under Section 9.
The contention that a trespasser could claim compensation for improvements made on the land without a bona fide claim of title was dismissed, aligning with precedents and statutory provisions.
