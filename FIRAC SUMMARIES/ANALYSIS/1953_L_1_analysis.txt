The interpretation of the will is crucial. The will's language indicates that Ranganayaki was to "enjoy" the properties for her lifetime, with the properties passing to Ramalakshmi and her heirs with "absolute rights" after Ranganayaki’s death. The testator's intent seems to be that the widow had a life estate, not an absolute estate, ensuring that the daughter and her heirs benefit from the properties. The will did not explicitly grant Ranganayaki the power to alienate the properties. Comparing this to a Hindu widow’s estate, Ranganayaki’s powers were more restricted, aligning with a life estate. Additionally, the circumstances show that there was sufficient income from the properties to fulfill obligations without the need for alienation. The fact that Ranganayaki did not alienate properties for over 21 years suggests she could manage without such powers.

Case law supports the interpretation that similar terms in wills are understood to limit the powers of the widow, ensuring that the next line of heirs receives the property intact. The broader intention and surrounding circumstances also indicate that the testator did not intend to give Ranganayaki the power to alienate the properties.
