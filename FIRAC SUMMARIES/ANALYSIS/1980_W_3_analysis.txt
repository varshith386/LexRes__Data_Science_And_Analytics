The correction made by the Industrial Tribunal was deemed necessary to clarify an accidental omission in the original award, specifically the intended flat increase in wages for all employees. The tribunal had the authority under Rule 31 to make such a correction, as it was not issuing a fresh award but merely correcting an inadvertent slip.
The tribunal's decision on wage revision and dearness allowance was based on a thorough consideration of the company's financial capacity to bear the additional burden. The tribunal's rationale and methodology for revising the wage scales and deciding against revising the dearness allowance were deemed satisfactory and not illegal.
