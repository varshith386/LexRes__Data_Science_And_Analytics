Dedication: The will’s language in Clause 3 indicated a clear intention of Dwarka Nath to dedicate premises No. 41 Grey Street absolutely to the deity. The property was to be registered and municipal bills taken in the deity’s name, with no rights of sale or mortgage by the testator’s heirs. The right of the sevayats to reside in the premises for performing seva does not detract from the absolute dedication, as supported by precedents.

Adverse Possession: Nagendra, as a sevayat, was in possession of premises No. 41A Grey Street on behalf of the idol. The trial court found that Nagendra’s possession was referable to the idol, and this finding was not challenged in the appellate court. A sevayat cannot claim adverse possession against the idol as their possession is inherently for the idol's benefit. Thus, any dealings by Nagendra post-1920 did not constitute adverse possession against the idol.

Rs 19,000 Claim: The High Court's disallowance of Rs 19,000 to the appellants was not seriously contested in the Supreme Court.
