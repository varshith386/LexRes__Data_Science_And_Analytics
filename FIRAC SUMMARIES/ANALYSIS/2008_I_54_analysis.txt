The prosecution's case relied heavily on circumstantial evidence, primarily the confessional statements of the accused, which led to the discovery of incriminating materials. However, the High Court found several issues with this evidence:

Voluntariness and Authenticity of Confessions: The statements made by the accused were under questionable circumstances, with allegations of coercion and fabrication by investigating officers. Statements made under duress or influenced by police misconduct are not admissible.
Recovery of Incriminating Materials: The materials recovered (knife, log, computer, gold ingots) did not conclusively link the accused to the crime. The prosecution failed to establish that the bloodstained clothes belonged to the accused or that the recovered items directly connected him to the murder.
Role of Other Suspects: Initial investigations also suspected other individuals (PWs 1-4). The High Court found that the investigating officer (PW-40) tried to falsely implicate these individuals, raising doubts about the integrity of the investigation.
Incomplete Chain of Evidence: The High Court concluded that the prosecution failed to present a complete chain of circumstantial evidence. Key elements, such as the absence of a direct link between the recovered items and the accused, and the lack of conclusive proof of the accusedâ€™s presence at the crime scene, left reasonable doubt.
