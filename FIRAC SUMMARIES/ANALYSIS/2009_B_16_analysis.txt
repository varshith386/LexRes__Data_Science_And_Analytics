Malini Mallya claimed copyright as the residuary legatee under Dr. Karanth's will, covering literary and dramatic works, including the Yaksharanga prasangas. The courts affirmed that dramatic works are a subset of literary works under the Act. They considered whether the performances in New Delhi constituted copyright infringement, applying tests of substantial similarity and permissible acts under fair dealing provisions. The courts also discussed the appropriateness of the injunction granted against the defendants.
