The Supreme Court scrutinized whether the acquisition was in public interest and complied with statutory procedures. It emphasized that while the construction of jails serves public interest, the State must strictly adhere to the procedural safeguards of the Land Acquisition Act. The Court noted a significant delay of almost a year between issuance of Section 4 and Section 6 notifications, undermining the claim of urgency under Section 17(4). It reiterated that Section 5A guarantees landowners a fair opportunity to object, and its dispensation should be justified only in cases of genuine urgency.

The Court invoked principles from previous judgments emphasizing strict construction of expropriatory statutes and the need to interpret public purpose in light of constitutional values. It highlighted that while public purpose evolves, it must align with constitutional principles and social justice imperatives.
