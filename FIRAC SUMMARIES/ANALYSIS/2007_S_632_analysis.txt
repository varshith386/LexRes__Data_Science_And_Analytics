The High Court erred in its judgment by not considering that the principles of natural justice need not apply if the appointments were fundamentally invalid.
The appointments were made without adhering to constitutional mandates of fairness and transparency (Articles 14 and 16).
Tayeng was not the competent authority to make these appointments; thus, they were deemed unauthorized.
The subsequent cancellation of appointments by the state was based on the absence of proper authority and records, rendering the initial appointments null.
The argument that the cancellation was inconsistent lacks merit because the primary basis for cancellation was the invalidity of the initial appointments, not procedural irregularities.
