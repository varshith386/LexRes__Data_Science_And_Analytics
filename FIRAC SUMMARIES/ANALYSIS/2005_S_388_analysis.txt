Conduct Report Requirement: The Supreme Court noted that the High Court did not call for a conduct report from the authorities as required by Section 4 of the POB Act. The appellant argued that this procedural lapse invalidated the High Court’s decision.
Non-Disclosure of Prior Conviction: The respondent failed to disclose his previous conviction in case No. 202 of 1997, where he was sentenced for similar offences under the DMC Act. This omission was considered an act of withholding vital information, amounting to fraud on the court.
Legal Precedents: The Supreme Court referenced previous judgments emphasizing the necessity of considering a probation officer’s report before granting probation and the significance of disclosing all relevant information to the court.
Aggravating Factors: The Court highlighted the large-scale unauthorized construction activities in Delhi and the need for strict enforcement of the law to deter such offences. The previous conviction of the respondent further justified the need for strict action.
Opportunity to Appellant: The High Court failed to provide the appellant (MCD) an opportunity to file a counter affidavit, which could have included the respondent's prior conviction details.
