Unexplained Delay:

The appellant was arrested on October 13, 2003, and released on bail on January 6, 2004. The detention proposal was made on December 2, 2004, but the order was issued only on April 5, 2005. The court found a significant part of this delay unexplained, especially the four-month gap after December 2004. The DRI’s letter dated December 20, 2004, indicated that transactions after October 11, 2003, were not under scrutiny, further questioning the delay.
Non-Placement of Vital Documents:

Documents indicating the exoneration of the appellant for earlier years and the de-freezing of bank accounts were not placed before the detaining authority. The civil court proceedings and orders relevant to the appellant were also not considered. This omission was deemed significant and impacted the validity of the detention order.
Non-Supply of Documents:

The self-inculpatory statements of the appellant and Prabhjot Singh, despite being material, were not supplied to the appellant. The detaining authority referred to these statements extensively, indicating their reliance on them. The failure to supply even the xeroxed copies of these statements to the appellant violated his right to make an effective representation.
Non-Application of Mind:

The detaining authority’s order contained contradictions, indicating a lack of genuine application of mind. While the authority cited the appellant’s and Prabhjot Singh’s statements extensively, it also stated in parts of the order that these statements were not relied upon, creating inconsistency.
