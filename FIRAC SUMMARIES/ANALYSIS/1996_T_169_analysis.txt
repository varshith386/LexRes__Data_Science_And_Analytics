The court analyzed the factual timeline and agreements between the parties:

Bona fide use: The appellant, through its predecessor Sen Raleigh, used the trademarks until agreements expired or were modified. This was sufficient to establish continuity of use.
Special circumstances: The court found that special circumstances, such as import bans and agreements with Sen Raleigh, did not excuse non-use by the respondents.
Unregistered licensee: Despite not being a registered user, the appellant's continuous use under agreements with Sen Raleigh was considered bona fide use.
Discretionary refusal: The High Court's refusal to rectify was supported by the continuous use of trademarks by the appellant and the absence of compelling reasons for removal.
