The court found that the AICTE had duly granted approval after considering various expert opinions and recommendations as per its regulations. The State Government's refusal, based on policy considerations and without demonstrating non-compliance with AICTE regulations, was deemed invalid. The university's requirement to seek the state government's views did not equate to requiring approval, and any attempt to enforce such approval would be repugnant to the AICTE Act.
