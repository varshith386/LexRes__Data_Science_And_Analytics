Procedure and Natural Justice: The government's procedure for reviewing price fixation was found to be within its discretion, provided it stayed within the set parameters. The manufacturers, being well-informed entities, could request relevant information during the review process. The government was obligated to disclose pertinent data reasonably but not all information considered in making the price order.
Information Disclosure: The government provided necessary information during the review hearings, meeting the demands of fair play for the affected manufacturers. The court emphasized that the manufacturers, well-versed in the industry details, could engage in discussions during the review process.
Delays in Review Disposal: The court acknowledged the importance of expeditious handling of review applications but held that delays did not inherently invalidate the price notifications. Manufacturers could seek judicial direction for timely disposal of their applications.
Interim Orders and Public Interest: The court observed that interim orders staying price notifications generally went against public interest. The interests of the consumer public should come first, and any interim relief should consider public welfare.
