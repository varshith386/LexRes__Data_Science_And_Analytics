The prosecution's case relied heavily on the testimonies of Bhimabai's parents, PW1 Tukaram and PW5 Sumanbai, who stated that the appellants demanded money for household expenses and manure, which led to the alleged harassment. However, Sumanbai's statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C did not initially mention that the cause of harassment was a demand for money and consequent beating, indicating inconsistencies in the prosecution's narrative. Additionally, the term "dowry" as defined in the Dowry Prohibition Act implies a demand connected to the marriage itself, not for meeting household or agricultural expenses post-marriage. The appellants were acquitted of charges under Sections 498-A and 306 read with Section 34 IPC by the Sessions Judge, and this acquittal was not challenged by the state.

The Supreme Court found that the demand for money for household expenses and manure did not meet the legal definition of dowry, as it was not connected to the marriage itself but rather to subsequent domestic needs. The evidence did not substantiate the claim that the demand for money constituted a demand for dowry under Section 304-B IPC.
