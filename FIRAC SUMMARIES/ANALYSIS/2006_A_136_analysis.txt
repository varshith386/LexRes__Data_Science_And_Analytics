Automatic Attachment: The Court found that under the Act, the properties of notified individuals are automatically attached, irrespective of their involvement in specific offences, thereby upholding the custodian’s action.
Individual Liabilities: The Court acknowledged that individual liabilities should be assessed separately, particularly for those not directly involved in Harshad Mehta’s transactions. The Special Court was directed to reconsider the individual liabilities of the appellants.
Custodian's Figures and Inspection: The Court noted that the Special Court accepted the custodian’s figures without detailed analysis and denied the appellants a proper inspection of documents. It directed a fresh hearing to allow the appellants to inspect documents and present their contentions fully.
Tax Liabilities: The Court recognized that several tax assessments were set aside by appellate authorities. It directed the Special Court to reassess the appellants’ tax liabilities, considering the subsequent appellate decisions and the principles laid out in prior judgments.
