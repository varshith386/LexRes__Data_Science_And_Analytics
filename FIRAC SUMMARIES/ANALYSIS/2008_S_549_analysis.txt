The High Court, in its revisional jurisdiction, examined the material evidence and found discrepancies in the appellants' claim of tenancy. Key findings included:

RTC entries did not explicitly show the appellants or their father as tenants.
The appellants failed to produce lease agreements or geni receipts to substantiate their claim of tenancy.
Inconsistent statements regarding the year and nature of tenancy further weakened their claim.
Section 4 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act stipulates that a family member cultivating land cannot be considered a deemed tenant, applicable since the appellants' father was related to respondent No. 3.
The Supreme Court, while acknowledging the High Court’s broader revisional powers under Section 121A compared to Section 115 of the CPC, concurred with the High Court's findings. The Supreme Court emphasized that the High Court’s conclusions were based on a thorough re-appreciation of evidence and highlighted the lack of substantial proof supporting the appellants’ claim of tenancy.
