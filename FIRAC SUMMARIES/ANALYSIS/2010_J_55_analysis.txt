Jurisdiction: The Supreme Court overruled the objection regarding the maintainability of the appeal, noting the procedural history and lack of specific objection in earlier stages.
Person Aggrieved:
The court delved into the concept of "person aggrieved" as interpreted in previous judgments and legal texts, distinguishing between Sections 46 and 56.
It was noted that the IPAB should have separately considered the locus standi of the first respondent for each registration.
The affidavit dated July 14, 2004, where the first respondent stated no ongoing dispute with the appellant, was crucial. The court emphasized that the grievance must exist when the application is made and continue till it is decided.
Public Interest and Consumer Confusion:
The court indicated that the IPAB should have factored in public interest and the potential for consumer confusion in its decision.
It underscored the importance of maintaining the purity of the register, which is in public interest.
