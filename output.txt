ORDER
This Writ Petition has been filed challenging the impugned proceedings  
dated 27.02.2015 bearing File No.21003/2014/A14 and consequential direction  3
to the respondents to confirm the tender in the name of the petitioner with  
regard to the collection of entry fee at the Kanagamoola Market, Vadasery,  
Kanyakumari District within the stipulated time.
2.The learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the petitioner  
submitted  a  tender  for  the  auction  scheduled  to  be  held  on  05.02.2015.  
According to the petitioner, the notification stipulates certain conditions being  
the qualification for participating in the sealed tender and as per the same, the  
tender has to be submitted by paying EMD of Rs.12,00,000/-, Bank Guarantee or  
Demand  Draft  of  Rs.30,00,000/-,  Rs.2,00,000/-  towards  Registration  Fee,  Rs.
1,00,000/- towards EB deposit.  The last date specified was as 05.02.2015 at 11.00  
a.m. and the date of opening was also scheduled on 05.02.2015 at 11.30 a.m.  
The petitioner had offered a sum of Rs.1,02,51,500/-  The sixth respondent also  
submitted a tender but according to the petitioner, it is a defective tender viz.,  
first of all, he has not mentioned the name and address and for which item he  
offered and the tender application was itself placed in a cover of HDFC bank  
without  indicating  anything.   Further,  as  contemplated  under  the  tender  
notification, the identification proof of the sixth respondent was not enclosed.  
As per the rules, he has to tender Rs.45,00,000/- totally but along with his  4
application, only Rs.44,00,000/- was enclosed.  Therefore, there is a deficit of Rs.
1,00,000/- at the time of filing the tender itself, though he has quoted a huge  
amount of Rs.1,39,99,999/-.  His tender suffers from one another disqualification  
viz., he is a tenant of another building of the municipality and he is in arrears of  
the lease amount to the tune of Rs.14,77,980/- upto March, 2015.  There is a  
specific clause in the present tender that when there is any arrears of amount,  
then such a person would be disqualified even from seeking for the tender.  
Therefore, on this sole ground also he cannot even participate in the tender.  
Even at the time of opening the tender, the petitioner had objected to open the  
very cover as it was only a HDFC bank cover.  But the sixth respondent being an  
influential person made the authorities to open the cover which was not even  
given the name and address but only a signature was there.  Since the amount  
offered by him is more, the matter was placed before the council.  In the council  
report also it has been very clearly pointed out that he is disqualified from even  
participating the tender but  the council members have agreed to grant it and  
the impugned order was passed just taking into consideration the extra amount  
offered by the sixth respondent.  Therefore, challenging the same, the petitioner  
has come forward with this Writ Petition.5
3.The  petitioner  has  also  given  an  undertaking  even  at  the  time  of  
admission itself that he is willing and prepared to pay the equal amount as  
agreed and made in the tender by the sixth respondent, even though he had  
made a lesser amount at the time of offering the tender.  Therefore, when there  
was only two people who had applied for the tender and one has become  
ineligible, according to the rules, automatically, the authorities ought to have  
given to the second highest bidder and now that he is offered to pay equal to  
the offer made by the sixth respondent, the tender has to be given only to him.  
Therefore, he challenges the very impugned order.
4.Though the municipality has not filed any counter, they would only  
contend that they are definitely interested in getting the best amount viz., the  
higher amount.  No doubt,  in the council meeting some councillors have  
objected to the grant of the contract to the sixth respondent but taking into  
consideration  the  vast  difference  of  Rs.37,00,000/-,  they  have  waived  the  
disqualification clause and alloted to the sixth respondent.  But at the same  
time, now they would state that if the petitioner offers equal to the amount  
offered by the sixth respondent and if the petitioner is prepared to deposit all  
the amount along with the income tax amount and other amounts, they will  6
abide by the Court order.
5.The  sixth  respondent  has  filed  a  counter  mainly  disputing  the  
disqualification ground raised as against him on the ground that the amount  
claimed as default to the municipality is not correct.  Further, there is an arrear  
of payment of rent but it is well within the security deposit of Rs.16,00,000/-.  
Further, the rent is in respect of a separate building.  Therefore, it cannot be  
called as he is in arrears of payment of licence fee.  Secondly, they would  
contend that the non-mentioning of the address is only an inadvertent mistake  
but however when they ensured the Demand Draft which has been taken from  
his account and there is no other person who has claimed as Maheen and he is  
already an existing contractor, licencee or lessee in respect of municipality.  
Therefore, there is no question of not enclosing his identification.  Therefore, he  
would contend that there is a mistake that he had given the Demand Draft for  
Rs.44,00,000/- but actually one Demand Draft was left out in the car and after  
opening the tender, immediately it was resubmitted.  But even though his name  
and address does not find a place in the cover, he has signed in the tender form  
and sent it in a cover of HDFC bank from where he got the Demand Drafts.  
Therefore,  these  are  all  only  small  discrepancies  which  can  be  cured  and  7
therefore, he cannot be called as a person who has been disqualified.  Further,  
he would contend that even as per the clause, if a person wants to challenge the  
tender, within 24 hours he has to pay the extra amount and thereafter, to  
challenge the same, which has not been done in this case.  Therefore, rightly the  
authorities have confirmed the tender in his favour.  He has also paid the  
amount.  Hence, the impugned order is sustainable.  Lastly, the counsel would  
contend that in the tender process the Court would not ordinarily interfere with.  
He would rely upon a decision in  S o r a t h  Buil d e r s  vs.  S h r e e j i k r u p a  
Buil d c o n  Li m it e d  an d  an ot h e r  [(2 0 0 9 )  11  S C C  9]  for  the 
proposition that  when the tender bid is not arbitrary the Court would not  
immediately interfere with the same. He would also rely upon a decision in  
Ja g d i s h  M a n d a l  v.  St at e  of  Oriss a  [(20 0 7 )  14  S C C  51 7]  for the 
proposition that evaluation of contract is essentially commercial functions and  
principles of equity and natural justice stay at a distance.  He would further rely  
upon  another  decision  in   M. V a s u d e v a n  v.  C.E. O.,  Che n n a i  
M et r o p o l it a n  Devel o p m e n t  Aut h o r it y  [AI R  20 0 6  M A D R A S  45]  
for the proposition that under the Tender Transparency Act, when the contract  
is  not  of  highly  specialized  work,  in  the  absence  of  any  rules  prescribing  
eligibility  requirement,  relaxation  of  eligibility  requirement  cannot  be  8
questioned.  Therefore, he would contend that the writ petition should be  
dismissed. 
6.The petitioner has filed an additional affidavit stating that in order to  
avoid the loss to the municipality, the petitioner is ready and willing to pay the  
amount of Rs.1,39,99,999/- which has been offered by the sixth respondent.
7.Heard all the parties.
8.The only point which has been raised and argued by all the parties is  
that the sixth respondent was disqualified.  Therefore, the authorities should not  
have confirmed the contract in favour of the sixth respondent, even though he  
had offered higher amount.  Let us analyse the various disqualifications which  
have been pointed out by the petitioner as against the sixth respondent.  The  
first and foremost disqualification pointed out is that in the application itself the  
name and address is not given.  The application was signed by the party and the  
application was not sent in proper cover and it is not mentioned for which item  
it has been given as a tender and it was in HDFC bank cover without denoting  
anything  in  respect  of  contract  or  tender.   Above  all  those  things,  the  9
application had Demand Drafts only for Rs.44,00,000/- instead of Rs.45,00,000/-  
and Rs.1,00,000/- towards EB deposit was not there at the time of opening of  
the tender.  No doubt, all these are accepted, there is no dispute in this.  
Further, another admitted fact is that at the time of opening the cover, the  
petitioner had objected to the very opening of the cover as it is not in the cover  
meant for tender and it is in the HDFC bank cover.  Nevertheless, at the instance  
of  the  sixth  respondent,  the  cover  has  been  opened  whereas  the  tender  
according to the petitioner is a defective tender.  No doubt, when the tender  
was  opened, the tender  application definitely not in the form it has been  
required.  Above all, the name and address of the person along with proof of  
identity was not available.  Though the argument is made by the learned counsel  
for the sixth respondent that after all he is an existing lessee in respect of the  
municipality, his whereabouts and name was very well known and nobody else  
who claims under his name and the Demand Draft also drawn from his account  
in  the  HDFC  bank  and  even  Rs.1,00,000/-  Demand  Draft  was  immediately  
submitted as it was left in the car and failed to be accompanied in the cover,  
one thing is clear that the very presentation is not proper and correct.  When  
the authority even could not identify the name and address, can that tender be  
called as valid tender merely because there was only a signature in it without  10
any further details including the name?  Let us assume in the reverse case,  
suppose he has mentioned everything viz., name and address but it was not  
signed, would the contract be accepted? No.  Similarly, this would also apply to  
the tender also.  The tender could not have been accepted at that point of time  
as it was not validly presented.  Even when the demand draft for Rs.1,00,000/-  
was not there, as contemplated in the tender notification, definitely it has to be  
taken note of.  Of course, in this case,  though it was not available at the time of  
opening the tneder, immediately he has gone to car and thereafter, brought it.  
But  the  fact  remains,  the  authorities  should  have  definitely  taken  into  
consideration that it is a defective presentation.  Even the cover does not  
contain any details and nothing was specified in the cover as contemplated  
under the tender notification.
9.The second limb of the argument is that the sixth respondent is not a  
defaulter.  The only argument placed before this Court is that the amount due  
and  payable  to  the  municipality  is  less  than  the  security  deposit  viz.,  Rs.
16,00,000/- and it can be adjusted from the same.  Therefore, he cannot be  
called as a defaulter.  Unfortunately, this argument cannot be accepted.  When  
the caution deposit is asked only for the due performance of the contract, that  11
does not mean that it should be kept as an advance for the payment due and  
payable by him.  When an arrear of Rs.14,77,980/- is due and payable, the  
authorities should not have taken into consideration merely because he has  
offered a higher amount.  Therefore, this also would indicate that there is a  
disqualification.  Further, the sixth respondent would state that since he has  
offered a huge amount and the difference is more than Rs.37,00,000/- the  
municipality  has  taken  into  consideration  even  though  there  were  some  
objections by the council members and the larger interest of the municipality  
for collection of money has accepted.  Therefore, they have taken the correct  
decision.  But, the municipality should have thought of a person who is a  
defaulter and merely because he has offered for more amount and when the  
very tender itself is a defective one, it should not have taken into consideration.  
10.In any view of the matter, now that the petitioner who is the only other  
participant has given an undertaking before this Court and filed an affidavit to  
the  effect  that  he  would  match  the  requirement  as  given  by  the  sixth  
respondent and as the application of the sixth respondent would have rejected  
on that day itself and the municipality should have accepted the lesser rate  
which was offered by the petitioner.  Now the petitioner has voluntarily agreed  12
to pay the entire amount as offered by the sixth respondent.  Alternatively the  
petitioner should have at least given an opportunity at that point of time that  
whether he was willing to pay more or not.  In fact, he had made an objection  
even on 05.02.2015 viz., when the date of opening the tender itself pointing out  
the irregularities and illegalities in granting the contract, no reply was given by  
the municipality and no opportunity of hearing was given to him to enhance the  
bid  amount.   The  petitioner  should  have  at  least  been  called  for  further  
negotiation.   Therefore, now the argument of the sixth respondent that as per  
the tender notification within 24 hours, he should have paid the highest amount  
does not arise.  Here is the case, the petitioner brings to the notice of this court  
that a tender which was offered by a person who is not at all eligible was  
considered.  Therefore, the question of invoking the clause to pay more amount  
within 24 hours is not correct.
11.In regard to the ruling stated by the petitioner, no doubt the Hon'ble  
Supreme Court has time and again stated that the consideration paramount in  
the nature is the price at which the other side is willing to do the work; whether  
the goods or services offered are of the requisite specification; whether the  
person tendering  has has the ability to deliver the goods or services as per  13
specifications.  The one of the very vital questions which has been decided by  
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in  S o r a t h  Buil d e r s  cas e  (cite d  supr a )  is 
whether the tenderer is willing to deliver the goods and services in the requisite  
quantity.  When he is not able to pay the rent for his building, in the tender how  
can be expected to do the contract payment in the future because after all, it is  
only a collection and payment of money.  Therefore, the sixth respondent's  
argument that normally in the contract matters the Court would not interfere,  
but, where it is proved that the authorities have flouted the rules that too on  
two  occasions  viz.,  when  at  the  time  of  opening  of  the  tender  itself  the  
disqualification pointed out by the petitioner they should have taken note of  
and at least they should have called the petitioner whether he is acceptable for  
discussion/negotiation.  Even that has not been done and his objection has been  
overruled without even giving an opportunity.  His objection has not at all been  
taken note of in the manner known to law.  The authorities have straight away  
passed the impugned order.  Therefore, it is a patent violation.  Hence, the  
impugned order is liable to be set aside. 
12.Now the question is how to give the contract when there were only  
two participants.  One participant as per the tender notification has become  14
ineligible, normally if the other participant is the only person, it is for the  
council to take a decision whether he has offered a  good amount or not.  But  
even as per the report of the Municipality in the council meeting it has been  
held as follows:

13.A reading of the agenda, it has been very clearly pointed out that the  
authorities themselves pointed that this is a clear violation of the tender rules  
"nJ Vy tpjpfis kPwpa brayhFk; ".  When this is considered in the council meeting,  
they have simply agreed for the higher amount.  But, at that point of time they  
should have called the petitioner so as to whether he is prepared to pay more or  
not, as already there is an objection, that has not been done.  Therefore, The  15
authorities  have  not  really  taken  into  consideration  the  above  defects.  
Therefore, the order has to go.  Now, the authorities should consider that when  
there is no other person and especially the period of contract commences from  
01.04.2015 and even as per the report of the council itself this amount is the  
highest amount, even taking into consideration the average of the previous  
three years, naturally the contract could be granted only to the petitioner at the  
highest amount as offered by the sixth respondent viz., Rs.1,39,99,999/- though  
the petitioner has offered lesser amount in the tender.  Now, he has filed an  
affidavit  accepting  to  pay  the  higher  amount  as  guaranteed  by  the  sixth  
respondent. Therefore, the petitioner should deposit the entire amount viz.,  
Total  lease  amount  Rs.1,39,99,999/-  +  service  tax  (12.36%)  Rs.17,30,400/-  +  
Income tax (2%) Rs.2,80,000/- + Profession tax Rs.2,346/- totally Rs.1,60,12,745/-  
(Rupees One Crore Sixty Lakhs Twelve Thousand Seven Hundred and forty five  
only) within a period of one week from today so that the authorities will have  
the entire collection at one go and in fact the petitioner has even brought to  
the Court a Demand Draft for Rs.50,00,000/- to show his bona fides.  Further,  
already he has deposited Rs.45,00,000/- towards deposit at the time of opening  
of  the  tender.  Therefore,  he  will  have  to  pay  the  entire  amount  viz.,  Rs.
1,60,12,745/- within one week from today.  1617
